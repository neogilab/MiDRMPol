# MiDRMPol
A high-throughput multiplexed amplicon sequencing workflow to quantify drug resistance mutations (DRMs) against protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. MiDRMpol is computational as well as labor efficient bioinformatics pipeline to detect DRMs from HTS data.The method can be incorporated in large scale surveillance of HIV-1 DRMs.
